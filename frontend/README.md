# Ello Engineering Challenge

ðŸ‘‹ Hello,
This is a submission of the Ello technical challenge program by <b>Martin M. Mugambi</b>, which allows teachers or students to add books they need to read on a reading list,
edit by way of removing the books they do not want to read from the reading list and finally viewing the reading list.

### Data - Backend
The program has a backend which provides data to the frontend via an API i.e graphql.
Navigate to the folder /backend and run the below commands :
```bash
npm install
```
Then run the following command to start the server
```bash
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the graphql playground in your browser.


### UI - Frontend

- The frontend interface has been created using React as the frontend framework.
- The file .env contains the URL to the backend i.e `http://localhost:4000/` where the backend is hosted on the same computer.
- The use of react hooks have been widely used to allow fetch and manipulate the data on the front end user interface.
- Library MUI i.e material-ui has aided in quick implementation of styled widgets and elements in addition to themeing using the colors provided.
- Execute the below commands to start the front end :

```bash
npm install
```
Then run the following command to start the server
```bash
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the Book assignment program in your browser.
